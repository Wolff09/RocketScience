	 * @brief Symbolic representation of a state transition system for modeling boolean while programs.
	 * @details
	 * # StateTransitionSystem
	 * A StateTransitionSystem is a symbolic representation of boolean while program encoded as state
	 * transition system. To encode such a boolean while program we need states and program variables.
	 * Both are encoded via boolean variables in the StateTransitionSystem. The number of variables
	 * held by a StateTransitionSystem is fixed, so you need to specify how many states and program
	 * variables you need upon creation.
	 * 
	 * ### Variables
	 * A StateTransitionSystem holds variables for encoding states and program variables. Beyond this
	 * classification, there are two types of variables (independent of states and program variables):
	 * *current* and *next* variables. These two types are used to model a configuration transition
	 * of system.
	 * 
	 * Each variable comes with a unique immutable id (aka. label) which can be accessed. This id is
	 * simultaneously the index of the variable in the vector you can access via variables().
	 * 
	 * In fact, each variable is internally followed by its next counterpart and the vector returned
	 * by variables() does contain variables for encoding states at the beginning and variables for
	 * the program variables at the end. However, one should not rely on this ordering. There are
	 * member methods for accessing states and program variables, for checking the type of variable
	 * and for converting *current* variables to *next* variables and vice versa.
	 * 
	 * Note that the index of a variable does not necessarily correspond to its position in the
	 * variable ordering!
	 * 
	 * Furthermore, be aware of the terminology. There are *variables* and *program variables*.
	 * The later one come from a program and are annotated to transitions. The former are BDD
	 * variables of the internal symbolic representation. The type (as in type system) of a variable
	 * is ```BDD```. I.e. a variable is a BDD with exactly one node containing a variable.
	 * Furthermore, both variables have an index. *program variable* have an continuous index
	 * between ```0``` and ```number_of_variables``` identify it uniquely. The internal
	 * *variables* do also have an index identifying them uniquely, however, there are no
	 * guarantees on the shape/range of this index.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ### Transitions
	 * Transitions are annotated with guards and actions, which are also represented symbolically.
	 * The guard formula states whether transition is enabled.
	 * The action formula describes the actions upon variables, i.e. how variables change their
	 * values by taking a transition. An action is supposed to only use program variables.
	 * Actions are usually of the following form:
	 * 
	 * 	x1' = !x1 & x2, x2' = x2 | x3
	 * 
	 * Note, that one can not directly feed this formula into the StateTransitionSystem since
	 * 	1. The '=' operator is not supported by Cudd. You have to circumvent this by expanding
	 * 	   the definition of equivalence, i.e.
	 * 	   ``` a <-> b |=| (!a | b) & (!b | a) ```
	 * 	2. Multiple actions are combined via conjunction.
	 * 
	 * So the above actions, for example, would look like the following:
	 * 
	 * 	(!x1' | (!x1 & x2) & (x1' | !(!x1 & x2)) & (!x2' & (x2 |Â x3)) & (x2' | & !(x2 | x3))
	 * 
	 * Note: The actions are *explicit*. Id est, variables that do not covered by an action
	 * are interpreted as "don't care". Thus you have to provide actions like ```x'=x``` for
	 * all variables which should not change.
	 * 
	 * ### BDDs
	 * All the symbolic representations are stored as BDDs. The used BDD library is Cudd.
